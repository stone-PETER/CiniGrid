## üîß Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

**New Collection:**

- `locationrecords` - Stores user-created location needs

**Updated Collections:**

- `potentiallocations` - Added `locationRecordId` and `teamNotes`
- `finalizedlocations` - Added `locationRecordId`, `potentialLocationId`, and `teamNotes`

### Migration Notes

**Backward Compatibility:**

- ‚úÖ All new fields are optional
- ‚úÖ Existing potential/finalized locations work without changes
- ‚úÖ Old workflow (requirements-based) still functional
- ‚úÖ New workflow can coexist with old workflow

**Future Migration:**

- Can gradually migrate from old "requirements" to new "location records"
- No data loss - both systems work independently

## üöÄ Backend Status

**Server:** ‚úÖ Running on port 5000  
**MongoDB:** ‚úÖ Connected

## üìã What's Next (Phase 2: Frontend)

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Create LocationRecordCard.tsx** - Display location record in left panel

3. **Create LocationRecordsPanel.tsx** - List of all records
4. **Create TeamNotesSection.tsx** - Display/add team notes
5. **Redesign LocationsScreen.tsx** - New 3-column layout

### Frontend Components Needed:

```
web/src/components/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LocationRecordCard.tsx (new)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CreateLocationRecordModal.tsx (new)

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Backend API Testing (Ready)

- [ ] Create location record via API
- [ ] Get all location records for a project
- [ ] Update location record
- [ ] Delete location record
- [ ] Add team note to potential location
- [ ] Edit own team note
- [ ] Try to edit someone else's note (should fail)
- [ ] Delete own team note
- [ ] Get all team notes for a location
- [ ] Verify notes preserved when finalizing

### Example Test Requests:

**1. Create Location Record:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/location-records \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "670123abc",
    "name": "Victorian Mansion",
    "description": "Large Victorian-era house with wraparound porch, ornate details, at least 5 bedrooms",
    "userNotes": "Needed for Acts 1-3, both interior and exterior shots"
  }'
```

**2. Add Team Note:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/locations/potential/123abc/team-notes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "note": "Perfect size and exactly the style we need!"
  }'
```

**3. Get Location Records:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/location-records/670123abc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Security

- ‚úÖ All endpoints require authentication (`authMiddleware`)
- ‚úÖ Project membership verified before access
- ‚úÖ Only admins can delete location records
- ‚úÖ Users can only edit/delete own notes
- ‚úÖ Finalized locations cannot be deleted if referenced

### Performance

- ‚úÖ Indexes on `projectId` and `locationRecordId`
- ‚úÖ Stats calculated efficiently
- ‚úÖ Populate only necessary user fields

### Data Integrity

- ‚úÖ Cascade protection (can't delete if finalized locations exist)
- ‚úÖ Orphan prevention (potential locations keep link even if record deleted)
- ‚úÖ Timestamp tracking for audit trail
- ‚úÖ Edit flags for transparency
