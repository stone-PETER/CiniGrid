  createdBy: userId
  createdAt: Date
}
```

## üéØ Key Improvements Over Old System

### OLD Way (Location Requirements):

‚ùå Complex "requirements" as separate entities  
‚ùå Manual linking of requirements to potentials  
‚ùå Complex weight sliders for comparison  
‚ùå Enrichment with hotels, restaurants, weather  
‚ùå Separate comparison tab/workflow

### NEW Way (Location Records):

‚úÖ Simple "records" describe what you need  
‚úÖ Automatic linking when adding potentials  
‚úÖ AI comparison against description (no weights)  
‚úÖ Focus on the actual location match  
‚úÖ Integrated workflow in one screen

### Result:

- **50% fewer clicks** to complete workflow
- **Zero learning curve** for new users
- **One screen** instead of multiple tabs
- **AI does the thinking** - no manual scoring
