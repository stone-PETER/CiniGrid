# Location Comparison Tool - API Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure the required API keys for the Location Comparison feature.

## üìã Overview

The Location Comparison tool uses three external APIs:

1. **Google Places API** (‚úÖ Already configured) - For nearby hotels, restaurants, parking, transit
2. **OpenWeatherMap API** (‚ö†Ô∏è Needs setup) - For weather data and forecasts
3. **Gemini AI** (‚úÖ Already configured) - For amenity extraction and expense estimation

---

## üîë API Keys Required

### 1. Google Places API (REQUIRED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already configured

**What it does:**

- Finds nearby hotels (top 5 within 3 miles)
- Finds nearby restaurants (top 5 within 3 miles)
- Locates public transportation (metro, bus stops)
- Finds parking facilities
- Calculates distances between locations

**Current Key:** `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` in `.env`

---

### 2. OpenWeatherMap API (REQUIRED)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS SETUP**

**What it does:**

- Current weather conditions
- 7-day weather forecast
- Best filming months based on climate
- Temperature, precipitation, wind data

#### Setup Instructions:

**Step 1: Create Free Account**

1. Go to: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Click "Sign Up" (top right)
3. Fill in your details (Name, Email, Password)
4. Verify your email address

**Step 2: Generate API Key**

1. Log in to your account
2. Go to: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
3. You'll see a default API key already created
4. Copy the API key (it looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`)

**Step 3: Activate API Key**

- **Important:** New API keys take 10-60 minutes to activate
- You'll receive an email when it's ready
- Test it after activation

**Step 4: Add to Environment Variables**

Open your `backend/.env` file and add:

```env
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual key.

**Step 5: Restart Backend Server**

```powershell
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm run dev
```

#### Free Tier Limits:

- ‚úÖ **1,000 API calls per day** (more than enough)
- ‚úÖ **Current weather** - Included
- ‚úÖ **5-day/3-hour forecast** - Included
- ‚úÖ No credit card required

#### Testing Your Setup:

```powershell
# Test API key (replace YOUR_KEY with your actual key):
$apiKey = "YOUR_KEY"
$url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Los Angeles&appid=$apiKey&units=imperial"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url
```

If successful, you'll see weather data for Los Angeles.

### 3. Gemini AI (OPTIONAL)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already configured

**What it does:**

- Extracts amenities from location descriptions (parking, WiFi, power, kitchen, etc.)
- Estimates location rental costs based on description and address
- Generates AI recommendations for location comparison

**Current Key:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`

**Note:** If not configured, the system will:

- Skip amenity auto-extraction (users can manually enter)
- Skip expense estimation (users can manually enter)
- Skip AI recommendations
- Core comparison features will still work

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

- [x] **Google Places API** - Already configured ‚úÖ
- [ ] **OpenWeather API** - Set up now (5 minutes) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [x] **Gemini AI** - Already configured ‚úÖ

---

## üß™ Testing the Complete Setup

### Test 1: Check Environment Variables

```powershell
cd backend
cat .env | Select-String "API_KEY"
```

You should see:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=...
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=...  ‚Üê Make sure this exists!
```

### Test 2: Test Location Comparison API

**Prerequisites:**

1. Backend running (`npm run dev`)
2. You have a project with potential locations
3. You've created a location requirement

**API Test:**

```powershell
# Get your auth token from browser DevTools (localStorage)
$token = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
$projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"

# Create a location requirement
$body = @{
  projectId = $projectId
  prompt = "Modern coffee shop"
  priority = "High"
  budget = @{ max = 1000 }
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/locations/requirements" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
  -Body $body
```

### Test 3: Run Comparison

```powershell
# Use the requirementId from Test 2
$requirementId = "..."

# Run comparison
$compareBody = @{
  weights = @{
    budget = 30
    similarity = 35
    crewAccess = 20
    transportation = 15
  }
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/locations/compare/$requirementId" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
  -Body $compareBody
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Compared X locations",
  "data": {
    "locations": [...],  // Ranked locations with scores
    "recommendation": "AI recommendation text...",
    "requirement": {...},
    "weights": {...}
  }
}
```

## üìä Feature Availability Matrix

| Feature                | Without OpenWeather | With OpenWeather |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Location Comparison    | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Budget Scoring         | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Similarity Scoring     | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Crew Access Scoring    | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Transportation Scoring | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Weather Data           | ‚ùå No               | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Forecast               | ‚ùå No               | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Best Filming Months    | ‚ùå No               | ‚úÖ Yes           |

**Bottom Line:** OpenWeather API is **highly recommended** but not strictly required. The comparison tool will work without it, but you'll miss weather insights.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OpenWeather API key not configured"

**Solution:** Check your `.env` file has `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=...`

### Issue: "Error 401: Invalid API key"

**Causes:**

1. API key not activated yet (wait 10-60 minutes after creation)
2. Typo in API key
3. Extra spaces in `.env` file

**Solution:**

```env
# ‚ùå Wrong (has spaces):
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = your_key_here

# ‚úÖ Correct (no spaces):
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Issue: "Error 429: Too many requests"

**Cause:** You've exceeded the free tier limit (1,000 calls/day)

**Solution:**

- Wait until tomorrow (limit resets daily)
- Upgrade to paid tier if needed
- Check for infinite loops calling the API

### Issue: Weather data shows "Unknown"

**Causes:**

1. API key not set
2. Location has no coordinates
3. API is down

**Solution:**

1. Check API key in `.env`
2. Verify location has valid lat/lng coordinates
3. Test API manually with curl/Postman
